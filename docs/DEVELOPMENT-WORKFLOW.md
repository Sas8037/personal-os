# Personal OS — Development Workflow

**Classification:** Current living, non-governing supplementary guide.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-31

This guide describes Git practices for Personal OS. It does not approve implementation work or replace the [Documentation Guide](DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md), [Improvement Register](IMPROVEMENTS.md), charter, or architecture. Use the actual checkout as the source of truth. The [File Registry](FILE-REGISTRY.md) distinguishes tracked source, local project files, and generated output.

## One file at a time; one logical change per commit

Inspect, edit, verify, and review each file separately before proceeding to the next authorized file. A logical commit may contain several related files that have each completed this process. For example, package configuration and its supporting documentation may belong together; unrelated editor settings or dependency cleanup do not belong in that commit.

Keep commits focused, reviewable, and as independently usable as practical. Do not split a manifest from a required lockfile update merely to make a one-file commit. One-file editing is a review discipline, not a requirement for one-file commits. Honor narrower task restrictions; permission to edit a file is not automatically permission to commit or publish it.

## Inspect → edit → verify → review → stage → commit → push → confirm

The commands below are workflow examples, not operations already performed or authorization to run them. Run commands from the repository root. Replace illustrative branch names and placeholders with the actual intended targets.

1. **Inspect.** Read task scope, relevant guidance, the register, and affected files. Record pre-existing changes so they are not accidentally committed. Inspect branch, upstream, remotes, and tracking:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git branch --show-current
   git branch -vv
   git remote -v
   git ls-files
   git diff --stat
   git diff --cached --stat
   ```

   Check untracked files individually. Use `git check-ignore` for ignored output; `git check-ignore --no-index` can examine ignore rules for already tracked dependencies. Do not print secret contents during inspection. A detached HEAD needs an intentional branch before new work is committed.

2. **Edit.** Change one authorized file at a time. Preserve unrelated work. When a file is created, deleted, renamed, or changes role/status, plan a separate registry synchronization step. Follow the existing improvement-register maintenance rules; inconsequential content edits do not automatically require registry updates.

3. **Verify.** Run checks appropriate to each file and the resulting logical change. Existing shell workspace commands are:

   ```bash
   npm run typecheck -w @personal-os/desktop-shell
   npm run build -w @personal-os/desktop-shell
   ```

   Prior owner-reported verification is recorded under IMP-002; later Codex tasks also passed shell typecheck/build and web production build. Report fresh results only when actually rerun. Build the shell before its compiled public exports are consumed by the React/Vite web host; output goes to ignored `packages/desktop-shell/dist/`.

   From the repository root, use `npm ci` for a reproducible clean installation from the committed lockfile; it replaces local installed dependencies. Clean-checkout reproducibility still requires GP-02 evidence. Use `npm install` for deliberate dependency updates and review the generated lockfile with the relevant manifest. Web workspace commands are:

   ```bash
   npm run dev -w @personal-os/web -- --port 5173 --strictPort
   npm run build -w @personal-os/web
   npm run preview -w @personal-os/web -- --port 4173 --strictPort
   ```

   Keep the Codespaces port-5173 preview private. A production preview serves the separate built artifact and needs its own browser evidence; development preview acceptance does not establish `/personal-os/` asset/routing readiness or public-deployment success.

   Playwright Test `1.64.1` is installed in the web workspace and `test:e2e` maps to `playwright test`. Chromium setup has not been reported complete; Playwright configuration and smoke/accessibility suites are absent, so do not run `npm run test:e2e -w @personal-os/web` merely because the script exists. IMP-007 proceeds through isolated local smoke testing, accessibility acceptance, then dedicated testing CI. GP-02 remains In progress, acceptance pending. No public Pages deployment or publication approval is established.

   For documentation, check referenced paths, classification, metadata where applicable, and whitespace. No documentation checker, root `docs:check`, or documentation CI is currently implemented; future tooling is IMP-008.

4. **Review.** Read the complete diff, not just the summary. For an existing documentation file, for example:

   ```bash
   git diff --check
   git diff -- docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md
   ```

   Ordinary `git diff` omits untracked files. Read a new file directly and, when useful, use `git diff --no-index -- /dev/null path/to/new-file` and its `--check` option. That path is illustrative. A no-index diff normally exits 1 when differences exist; distinguish that from an actual error. Confirm that only intended files changed and no generated output or secrets are included.

5. **Stage.** Stage explicit reviewed paths rather than blanket staging. For a reviewed registry-only change:

   ```bash
   git add -- docs/FILE-REGISTRY.md
   git diff --cached --name-status
   git diff --cached --check
   git diff --cached
   git status --short
   ```

   Do not use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git commit -a` as defaults. Review the entire staged diff, including any changes already staged before this task. Staged content is the commit content; later edits require another review and explicit staging. Stop if the index includes unrelated work.

6. **Commit.** Once authorized and the staged scope/checks are satisfactory, create a Conventional Commit. This illustrative message refers to the existing registry improvement:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs(registry): document the repository file inventory" -m "Record tracking states and evidence limits." -m "Refs: IMP-016"
   git show --stat --oneline HEAD
   ```

   A local commit is not a push, CI result, or browser test. Inspect the resulting commit for the intended files and message. Verification-only tasks that change no files require no empty commit or push.

7. **Push.** Confirm the destination repository, local branch, remote branch, and upstream immediately before publishing. At this guide's review, `origin` points to `https://github.com/Sas8037/personal-os` and the local branch is `main`; this observation is not permission to push to main or a promise that future remotes are unchanged. Fetch the intended remote when authorized, inspect divergence, and resolve it without overwriting others' work. On an authorized new topic branch, an explicit example is:

   ```bash
   git remote get-url --push origin
   git branch --show-current
   git push --set-upstream origin docs/imp-015-accuracy
   ```

   `docs/imp-015-accuracy` is an illustrative branch, not a claim that it exists. Use the actual reviewed branch. Avoid implicit destinations when upstream configuration is uncertain. A rejected non-fast-forward push requires inspection and integration; never default to force-pushing. Force-push and published-history rewriting require separate explicit authorization and coordination.

8. **Confirm.** After an authorized push, inspect status and compare the remote branch's advertised hash to the intended commit:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   git status --short --branch
   git ls-remote origin refs/heads/docs/imp-015-accuracy
   ```

   Replace the illustrative branch with the actual destination. Report a mismatch, network failure, or remaining local changes honestly. Do not claim synchronization from a local commit or stale remote-tracking reference alone. Check CI separately if available; push success does not establish CI success.

## Conventional Commits

Use `type(scope): imperative summary`. Keep the subject concise (aim for 72 characters or fewer), use an imperative verb such as “add,” “correct,” or “document,” and omit a trailing period. Choose a type that describes the actual change.

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | Add user-facing functionality or a public capability |
| `fix` | Correct faulty behavior |
| `docs` | Change documentation |
| `refactor` | Restructure code without intended behavior changes |
| `test` | Add or correct tests |
| `build` | Change dependencies, compilation, packaging, or build configuration |
| `chore` | Perform repository maintenance |
| `ci` | Change CI configuration, when it is introduced |
| `perf` | Improve measured performance without changing intended behavior |
| `security` | Remediate a security weakness; avoid disclosing sensitive details |

Useful scopes are `web`, `shell`, `runtime`, `api`, `docs`, `registry`, `repo`, `kernel`, `storage`, and `ai`. Scopes identify responsibility, not implementation status: the reusable shell and thin React/Vite web host are Current, and runtime/API/kernel/storage/AI implementations remain Planned. Select the narrowest useful scope; use `repo` for a genuinely repository-wide logical change.

The tracked [`.gitmessage`](../.gitmessage) provides comment-only guidance for the structure below. Configure each clone separately from the repository root with `git config --local commit.template .gitmessage` and verify `git config --local --get commit.template`. This local setting is Git metadata, not shared configuration. Replace guidance with factual content; comments/placeholders must not become the final message. Using explicit commit messages does not imply editor-template behavior was tested.

Separate the body from the subject with a blank line. Use the following recommended structure, scaling detail to the change:

1. **Subject:** `type(scope): imperative summary`.
2. **Brief summary:** Explain what changed and why it was needed.
3. **Changes:** Describe meaningful behavior, scope, and implementation decisions.
4. **Verification:** Identify checks actually performed and their results.
5. **Impact:** Where relevant, explain compatibility, operational effects, risks, and limitations.
6. **Refs footer:** Reference applicable stable improvement IDs, such as `Refs: IMP-018`, separated from the body by a blank line.

Use factual, specific descriptions. Avoid generic boilerplate such as “improve code quality” or “all tests pass” without naming the relevant change or checks. Do not fill sections merely to satisfy a template. Trivial edits can use a concise body with the relevant verification; architectural, security, build, or repository-wide changes warrant more detailed reasoning, evidence, and impact. Wrap body text for readability and use short lists when they make parallel changes or checks easier to review.

Verification must distinguish fresh tests from prior owner-reported evidence. Name the actual command or manual review, its scope, and the observed result. Attribute earlier results and dates where useful; never imply they were rerun. If no tests were run, say so and explain the relevant verification used instead. State material unverified capabilities, skipped checks, failures, and limitations. Local type checking, compilation, browser testing, and CI are separate evidence; none substitutes for another.

Reserve `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` and a subject `!` for actual incompatible public changes, with migration details. IMP references do not close or approve register entries automatically; update status based on evidence and owner decisions. Examples below use real IMP identifiers and illustrate recorded work, not commands to execute or proof that checks were performed in a new task. Replace example evidence with actual results when writing a new commit.

Documentation example:

```text
docs(docs): distinguish current files from planned architecture

Replace historical starter claims with checkout-backed descriptions so
readers can distinguish implemented files from future design.

Changes:
- Separate Current, Planned and Historical inventory entries.
- Remove links to absent starter files.

Verification:
- Check local documentation links and referenced checkout paths.
- Review the complete staged diff and pass whitespace checks.
- No compiler or browser tests run for this documentation change.

Impact:
- Clarify implementation status without changing accepted architecture.

Refs: IMP-015
```

Historical implementation/build example (its unverified-browser wording describes that earlier stage, not the current GP-01 baseline):

```text
build(shell): expose compiled desktop shell entry points

Make the reusable shell consumable through its public package name
with a strict, repeatable TypeScript build.

Changes:
- Add package compiler configuration and build/typecheck scripts.
- Expose compiled JavaScript and declaration entry points.
- Generate source and declaration maps for debugging.

Verification:
- Prior owner-reported IMP-002 evidence records successful shell
  type checking, build and public entry resolution on 2026-10-29.
- Those checks were not rerun for this illustrative message.

Impact:
- Target a bundler-based frontend host.
- Browser rendering and full host integration remain unverified.

Refs: IMP-002
```

Repository-maintenance example, reflecting the completed index cleanup:

```text
chore(repo): stop tracking installed dependencies

Remove installed dependencies from the repository baseline while
preserving the local installation and reproducible root lockfile.

Changes:
- Remove 259 node_modules entries from Git tracking only.
- Leave project source, manifests and lockfile unchanged.

Verification:
- The recorded cleanup checked zero remaining tracked entries and
  unchanged contents/targets for 531 local dependency files and links.
- Shell typecheck, shell build and workspace resolution passed during
  that cleanup; these are prior results, not fresh tests for this example.
- The complete staged patch contained only dependency deletions and
  passed whitespace checks.

Impact:
- Keep installed dependencies local under existing ignore rules.
- Make no claim of browser testing or CI verification.

## Branches, grouping, and pull requests

Use short-lived topic branches for distinct changes, with descriptive names such as the illustrative `docs/imp-015-accuracy` or `feat/imp-001-preview`. Confirm the intended base before creating or switching branches. Do not switch away from unrelated uncommitted work without first agreeing how to preserve it. Keep main ready for reviewable integration; direct pushes to main require the owner's chosen workflow and repository permissions.

Group only files that implement or explain the same coherent change, even if reviewed in separate steps. Keep tracked-dependency cleanup separate from feature implementation. Avoid mixing accidental formatting churn with substantive changes.

When the repository workflow calls for a pull request, push the topic branch and describe the problem, outcome, IMP references, checks performed, checks not performed, and remaining limitations. Review every file and the destination branch before merging. PR creation, review, and merge are distinct from pushing; no automated checks or branch protections are assumed to exist. Follow configured protections and the owner's approval process, without treating a PR as architecture approval.

## Files requiring care

- **Untracked files:** Inspect purpose, contents, and relevance before explicit staging. A local file is not yet part of the committed baseline. Local editor/environment settings are not automatically shared project configuration.
- **Ignored/generated output:** Keep shell/web `dist/` and web `test-results/`/`playwright-report/` out of source commits. Do not force-add ignored files by default. Rebuild when needed; generated files are not proof of fresh verification.
- **Tracked dependencies:** IMP-017 removed the former 259 `node_modules/` entries from tracking; current Git inspection confirms zero remain. Dependencies are installed locally and ignored. Prior owner-reported preservation evidence is distinct from a fresh file-integrity check. This guide authorizes no cleanup; any future cleanup must verify local preservation, ignore rules and the exact staged scope.
- **Secrets:** Review staged configuration and lockfile registry URLs for credentials, tokens, private endpoints, and personal data without echoing secrets into logs. Keep environment credentials out of Git. If a secret has been committed or pushed, stop publication, revoke/rotate it as appropriate, and coordinate remediation; deleting a file in a later commit does not erase history.
- **Lockfiles:** Commit intentional changes to the existing root `package-lock.json` with the dependency-manifest change they resolve. Do not edit generated lock data manually or regenerate it to hide unrelated changes. Review dependency/version and registry changes. The root lockfile is committed and synchronized with shell/web declarations, including Playwright Test `1.64.1`. Installed tooling alone does not establish a passing test suite; repeatable clean-checkout installation/build remains a separate GP-02 check.

## Safe recovery

Inspect `git status`, unstaged/staged diffs, and the intended commit before recovery. Preserve wanted work before discarding anything. Use explicit paths, and do not operate on unrelated changes.

| Situation | Preferred approach and effect |
| --- | --- |
| Accidentally staged a reviewed file | `git restore --staged -- docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` unstages that example file while preserving working-tree content. It does not undo an already committed change. |
| Want to discard an unwanted tracked-file edit | Only after confirming that the edit can be lost, `git restore --source=HEAD -- path/to/file` replaces the illustrative path's working-tree content with HEAD. This can destroy uncommitted work; it is not the default response to a dirty tree. |
| Need to undo a published commit | After reviewing its effects and dependencies, use `git revert <commit>` to create a new inverse commit rather than rewriting shared history. Placeholder syntax must be replaced with the actual reviewed commit. Handle conflicts deliberately; merge reverts require additional parent selection and review. |
| Need to unstage with older Git | `git reset HEAD -- path/to/file` resets only the illustrative path's index state and preserves working-tree files. Prefer the clearer `git restore --staged` form where available. |
| Need to revise an unpublished local commit | Consider a follow-up commit first. Moving a branch with `git reset` requires explicit agreement and a recovery reference; `--soft` preserves index/worktree content, while mixed reset preserves working-tree content but resets the index. Neither is a default action on shared history. |

Do not default to `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, force-push, or deleting directories. Resetting tracked paths is not a way to recover untracked files. If recovery is uncertain, stop and preserve the work before proceeding.

## Verification and reporting

Distinguish evidence precisely:

- **Local verification:** Commands actually run and their results, with relevant scope. Strict shell type checking and compilation do not establish browser behavior.
- **Browser testing:** Actual rendering, refresh, interactions, and URL/environment checked. GP-01 is Completed based on owner-reported private Codespaces rendering, truthful offline status, refresh, desktop/mobile usability and a clean Incognito console; IMP-001 is Verified. Prior Codex build/server/Host-header checks are separate evidence. Automated browser testing remains pending; record Codespaces, production-preview and public-site results separately.
- **CI verification:** A specific remote workflow/run and result. CI is not currently implemented; a successful local check or push is not a CI pass.
- **Owner-reported evidence:** Attribute prior results explicitly rather than implying they were rerun.

For each commit/push handoff, report the commit hash (or “not committed”), branch, changed files, checks/tests and results, checks not run, and remote status (not pushed, push failed, or confirmed remote branch/hash). Include remaining staged/unstaged/untracked work relevant to the task. Never describe local completion as published completion.

Registry/index integration and IMP-018 workflow adoption are published. Remaining registry/register status synchronization and PWOS implementation-snapshot reviews are separate one-file documentation steps under IMP-015. Creating this supplementary guide changes neither the five-document governing set nor approved architecture.
